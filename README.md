# Zsteg-An-efficient-steganographic-tool
This repository showcases my undergraduate thesis research project on how to hide bits of cipher inside RGB digital images.

In this work, steganography refers to the method of hiding secret messages in seemingly ordinary digital cover
mediums, for example, images, video, or audio files. In the current era of evolving cyber threats, this craft can be instrumental in preserving the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive data transmitted through different channels. This paper introduces a distinctive technique for choosing specific bits within the cover medium file to embed the cipher (i.e., encrypted secret message).The objective is to prevent intruders from identifying these crucial bits, even in the event of a compromised encryption key.Following this, one steganography tool was developed, incorporating the proposed algorithm. In the evaluation of performance,the tool showcased better results in specific metrics than other existing tools.

The main contribution of this work is to minimize the detectability of the digital cover image in the field of steganography.
The evaluation showed that achieving a lower mean square error and signal-to-noise ratio helps enhance this goal.
Yet, this improvement came with a trade-off: a significant reduction in the amount of data that can be concealed. Therefore,
future efforts should aim to improve payload capacity without making it easier to detect.
